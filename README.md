# CDSKit: C Data Structures Kit

A small and simple library with some data structures I implemented for my uni course.

## Notes

- I'm not sure if the void\* approach for generic structs is used on C. Maybe it losses all the sense of the language of having performance but this is how I wanted to implement it.
- This library is not finished yet lol.
