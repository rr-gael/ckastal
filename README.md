# Ckastal: C Kit for Data Structures and Algorithms

A small and simple library with some data structures I implemented for my uni course. Will update with the algorithms implementation when I have a chance or get to that course.

## Notes

- I'm not sure if the void\* approach for generic structs is used on C. Maybe it losses all the sense of the language of having performance but this is how I wanted to implement it.
- This library is not finished yet lol.
